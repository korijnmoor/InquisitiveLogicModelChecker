# InquisitiveLogicModelChecker

In short, inquisitive logic is a logic framework aimed at incorporating questions and inquisitiveness into 'classical' notions of logic. The model checker is a simple collection of python code which is capable of representing inquisitive logic models and checking whether those models uphold various formal rules of the inquisitive logic framework.

I developed this model checker for inquisitive logic as part of [my bachelor thesis](https://scripties.uba.uva.nl/search?id=720324) for the Artificial Intelligence (bachelor) program at the University of Amsterdam (UvA).

## Technologies
Python 3.x

## Installation/usage
The model checker is just simply a collection of Python scripts. There is no need to install anything really (except for some missing modules maybe). Just download all the files and run the main.py file with your Python interpreter of choice.

## How to use
When you run main.py you are presented with the command-line interface which you will use to interface with the program. Entering "h" (enter) will print a rudimentary help message, where all the commands you can use are listed.

## Notes
Please do be aware that this program is part of my bachelor thesis and is therefore mainly aimed at providing a proof of concept rather than a highly optimised (and especially safe) user experience. In other words use at your own risk (see the [license](../main/LICENSE) for more information).
